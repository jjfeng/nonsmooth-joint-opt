External packages needed:
* CVXPY is required for all scripts
* Install Spearmint https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint
* Biopython is required to run the colitis data analysis

Create folders:
* In this directory, create
  * spearmint_descent directory
  * results directory
  * For each example, it will need its own results folder:
      * e.g. results/matrix_completion_groups/tmp

Section 3 results were generated as follows:
* Elastic Net:
    python elasticnet_eval.py
* Sparse group lasso:
    python sgl_eval.py
* Sparse Additive models:
    python sparse_add_models_eval.py

Section 4 results were generated as follows:
    python realdata_eval.py

By default, the code solves the joint optimization problem via gradient descent.
The python commands take in different commands
Specify different solvers
